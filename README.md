## Cash Register Web App 

This cash register web application is a project I completed while following a FreeCodeCamp training course. It demonstrates essential web development skills like using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and user-friendly interface.

**Features:**

* Calculates change due based on the entered customer cash and item price.
* Handles exact cash scenarios and displays appropriate messages.
* Displays the available denominations and their amounts in the cash drawer.
* Provides visual feedback through a styled user interface.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter a price for the item (modify the `price` variable in `script.js` if needed).
4. Enter the amount of customer cash in the input field.
5. Click the "Calculate Change" button or press Enter to see the calculated change due and the updated cash drawer contents.

**Built with:**

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

**Learning Experience:**

Through building this cash register application, I gained experience in:

* Structuring web pages using HTML.
* Applying CSS styles to enhance the visual design.
* Utilizing JavaScript for user interaction and dynamic content updates.
* Understanding core web development concepts and their practical implementation.

**Future Improvements:**

* Implement additional features like handling different currencies or managing multiple item purchases.
* Integrate error handling for invalid user inputs.
* Enhance the user interface for a more polished look and feel.

I hope this project provides a glimpse into the world of web development! Feel free to explore the code and experiment with further improvements.
